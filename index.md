Welcome to the Rutgers astro lifehacks page. Here we (a bunch of astronomy gradudate students), have compiled some resources that we've found to be useful during our time here. These include beginner tutorials for coding, repositories of useful documents (such as the department's Ph.D. dissertaiton TeX template), recommendations of local bars and restaurants, and much more.

# [](#department)Quick links around the Rutgers physics department


# [](#computing)General computing resources for doing research in astronomy


# [](#python)A curated list of useful python guides and modules


# [](#life)How to make the most out of your time *outside* of grad school


# [](#misc)Miscellaneous stuff that we couldn't cram elsewhere
