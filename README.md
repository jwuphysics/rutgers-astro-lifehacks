## Rutgers astro lifehacks

A cache of life hacks for Rutgers (astronomy) graduate students.

### Background

Ph.D. students often have to juggle classwork, research, teaching, and [writing a dissertation](http://phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1164). But we've all wasted time searching for the correct reimbursement form or finagling some TeX template to make it compile properly. Why not create a central repository for all of this wisdom that we grad students have gained over all these years?

### Usage
